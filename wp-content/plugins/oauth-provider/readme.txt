Special thx to [DigitalCube Co. Ltd.](http://www.digitalcube.jp/ "DigitalCube Co. Ltd.")!

Thx. Robert!
So, what I've noticed is that in this file one parameter is called "callbackurl" which should be called "oauth_callback", according to the rfc: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849

= Localization =
"OAuth Provider" has been translated into languages. Our thanks and appreciation must go to the following for their contributions:

* French (fr_FR) - Jeremy Castellano
* Japanese (ja) - [OKAMOTO Wataru](http://dogmap.jp/ "dogmap.jp") (plugin author)

If you have translated into your language, please let me know.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `oauth-provider` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

The control panel of OAuth Provider is in 'OAuth Provider'.

After enabled this plugin, you can access URLs as below:
(suppose your WordPress's URL is `http://example.com/`)

* `http://example.com/oauth/request_token`	The URL to obtain a Request Token.
* `http://example.com/oauth/authorize`		The URL to obtain User authorization.
* `http://example.com/oauth/access_token`		The URL to issue an Access Token.
* `http://example.com/oauth/(method name)`		The URL to call a OAuth method using a Consumer key and an Access Token.


The OAuth method `sayHello`, which is implemented in this plugin for now, is simply returning a user name.

You can register a method using `add_oauth_method($name, $method)`.
You can use this function like `add_filter()`. 

You can easily add the sayHello method like below:
`add_oauth_method('sayHello', create_function('$request, $userid, $username', 'return "Hello {$username}!";'));`

To execute the registered sayHello method, access the URL below:
`http://example.com/oauth/sayHello`
